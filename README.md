# Information Theory -  Compressorion Algorithms
Today, there are many different types of compression algorithms. Every different type is best suitable for a specific type of data. In this project, we have researched and implemented some various compression algorithms on different types (such as entropy based, dictionary based, etc.) in order to compare their performance on a given text file, and find the algorithm with the optimal compression ratio. Additionaly, we added our own improvements, to make the algorithm more efficient.
